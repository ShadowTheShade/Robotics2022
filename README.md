The Crc duino takes 2 sources of power to operate: one to run the controller board and the other to power the Pins. It can use the same source (12V) but the source needs to be split into to paths.


LEDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FastLED library is a powerful tool for the neopixels, you just need to know the amount of neopixels on the strip and they you can program any function you want to get the lights running. Recommended resistors and capacitors for powering the neopixels to prevent damage.
